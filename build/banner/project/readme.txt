The example texture provided is large.
You will have to export it as RGBA4 (RGBA8 will be too big)
It's possible to use smaller textures so you get more colors, but you're on your own.
You will need to install the "textool" directory's NW4C_Photoshop_Plugins from a Nintendoware package to export a ctex from photoshop
(There may be other ways, namely, texture conversion tools, but I don't use them)

Be sure you zoom in and out on the icons in the home menu and watch what happens when my "bad idea" icons scale.
